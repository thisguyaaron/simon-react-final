# simon-react

I learned many different things while doing this project. Basically, from a very high level it creates web applications very efficiently.

It allows you to basically only have 1 html element and react helps cut down many files making the project simple. 

React only has a virtual dom which relies upon the actual dom. React  figures out the least "expensive" way to patch the actual dom without rendering the actual DOM. 

Reactâ€™s role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution. 

I learned a ton on this simon and I cant wait to use react in the future.
